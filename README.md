=====================================
9/27/2015

--------------------------

> The purpose of this project is to demonstrate one's ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
> 
> One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article.
> http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
> 
> Here are the data for the project: 
> https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
> 
> You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
> 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
> 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
> 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
> 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
> 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
